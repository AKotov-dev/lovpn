Specify the download directory and click the "Start" button. Since the configurations are free, there will be non-working ones among them, but most of them work. In total, about 200 configurations are loaded. To connect, it is convenient to use [Luntik](https://github.com/AKotov-dev/luntik) or [OpenVPN-GUI](https://github.com/AKotov-dev/OpenVPN-GUI). RPM and DEB packages are presented.
